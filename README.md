# CommentSpammer
Spam comments on a friend's Facebook post using Selenium and Python

## Instructions

Requires selenium
py -3 -m pip install selenium

1. Download a suitable version of chrome driver. https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. Change the path for the downloaded chromedriver.exe
2. Update userId and password with your Facebook credentials.
3. Change nouns, adjectives etc. as needed.
4. Change the number of comments, delay between comments, and link to post in the last line.

This script is poorly written and relies on time delays to work. 

PS - Facebook will step in and stop you from commenting after a while.
